## 🧾 About

The **To-Do List App** is a simple web application developed using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
It allows users to manage their daily tasks easily with options to add, edit, delete, and mark them as completed.

All the tasks are stored in the browser’s **localStorage**, which means they remain saved even after refreshing or closing the browser.

This project was created as a **student project** to practice front-end web development and data storage using localStorage.
